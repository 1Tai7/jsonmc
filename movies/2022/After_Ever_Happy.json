Tessa is the only one capable of understanding and calming him...he needs her, but she is no longer the good, sweet girl she was when she first came to college. She will have to ask herself if what she must do now is to save Hardin and her relationship with him, or if the time has come to think only of her. If they want their love to survive, they will have to work on themselves first. But will it be their destiny to stay together?"
